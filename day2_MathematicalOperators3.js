// RELATIONAL AND COMPARISON OPERATORS

// note - There is a  \n it is used to break the code to next line or it is executed in the next line 

console.log("Masai School"+"\n"+"A Transformation in Education") 

// Relational operators work on numbers and they give output in boolean (BOOLEAN outputs are True & False)
// They areare  >,<,>=,<= (< is less than, > is greater than)
// a>=b means a greater than or equal to b, its only false if a is less than b 
// a<=b means a less than or equal to b, its only false if a is greater than b 

// Comparison operators works on both STRINGS and Numbers  and output will always be boolean 
// a==b means a is equal to b , its false for all other scenarios like greater than or less than
// a!=b means a is not equal to b , its false only if both are equal
// p.s the following operators do not check data types
